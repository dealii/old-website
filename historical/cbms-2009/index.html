<h2>General Information</h2>
<p>
Finite element methods are versatile tools in the computational
solution of partial differential equations in physics and engineering.
When solutions exhibit localized features, adapted finite element
meshes based on error estimations are a frequently used technique to
reduce the effort to compute a good approximation. They can accelerate
the solution process by orders of magnitude. This short course will
deal with the derivation, analysis and application of such methods.
</p>

<p>
The principal lecturer, Rolf Rannacher, has been among the leading
researchers in this field for 15 years and is a driving force behind
goal oriented error estimation. This technique produces estimates
directly related to measurements relevant in applications. As opposed
to many other techniques, it has been applied successfully to a
wide class of nonlinear problems. The CBMS conference will give a
detailed overview over a posteriori error estimation for a variety of problems 
in partial differential equations, optimization, and eigenvalue computation. 
The presentation of theory will be augmented by hands-on
sessions allowing participants to explore practical aspects of these
techniques.
</p>

<p>
Although termed "conference", CBMS conferences are actually lecture
series with no contributed talks. They are targeted at young
researchers who want to learn about the field presented. Nevertheless,
we will provide opportunity for short, informal presentations of the
participants upon request.
</p>

<p>
NSF has provided us with funds to defray travel and accomodation costs
for a limited number of students. Applications for support should be
sent by <b>email to the organizers by March 15th</b>, 2009. Note, however,
that CBMS conferences are <i>regional</i> and so support will be
preferentially given to participants from Texas and closeby states of the US.
In your application for support, please include
the name of your PhD advisor, postdoc mentor or a similar reference,
if available. We will try to support as many applicants as our budget
allows and might therefore ask you to make joint travel arrangements
with other participants from your institution.

</ol>


<h3>Registration</h3>

Please register by March 31st sending email to one of the
organizers. Email is also the preferred means of contact for all other
inquiries.

<h2>Lecture series</h2>

The lecture series is targeted at graduate students and young
researchers in applied mathematics as well as science and engineering
with interest in the numerical solution of partial differential
equations. Advanced undergraduate students with some knowledge of
finite element methods are encouraged to participate.

Please see <a href="lectures.html">here</a> for a detailed description
of the lectures.

<h2>Lab sessions</h2>

In addition to the lecture series, we will offer lab sessions to the
participants. Those will provide hands-on experience of the methods
presented in the lectures.

<p>
The lab sessions will be conducted by the organizers and will feature
the finite element library <a href="http://www.dealii.org">deal.II</a>. We
will give a basic introduction to the use of this library and show how to
construct simple finite element codes. We will also give an overview of the
more complicated applications featured in
the <a href="http://www.dealii.org/6.2.0/doxygen/tutorial/index.html">deal.II
  tutorial</a>. 

<p>
We will base lab sessions on version 6.2 of deal.II, which can be downloaded
<a href="http://www.dealii.org/download/index.html">here</a>. We will provide
access to computers for everyone during the afternoon lab sessions. However,
if you feel more comfortable using your own laptop, you can also download the
library to it and follow the installation instructions at
<a href="http://www.dealii.org/6.2.0/readme.html">this page</a>. Note that
deal.II runs right out of the box on Linux and Mac OS X; on Windows, you need
the <a href="http://cygwin.org/">Cygwin environment</a>.
