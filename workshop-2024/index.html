	      <h3>Program and Topics</h3>

	      <p>
		The workshop will have time for both talks and
		"hackathon"- or "code jam"-style time to work jointly on
		everyone's projects 
		with plenty of people to ask and get help from.
		We invite talks and plan discussions by users and existing
		developers in areas including these:
		<ul>
		  <li> Use cases and applications of the library
		  <li> What users think would be useful directions for the library
		    to go into, things that are missing, and possibly getting
		    people together who can help implement those parts
		  <li> Newer parts of the library and
		  how these could help in your programs.
		</ul>
	      </p>

	      <p>
		<b>Schedule:</b>
		<ul>
		  <li> August 11: arrival
		  <li> August 12-16: deal.II workshop
		  <li> August 16 or 17: departure

	      <h3>Code of Conduct</h3>

              <p>
                Colorado State University is receiving funding from
                the National Science Foundation to support this
                conference. As a condition of the conference grant,
                NSF requires that CSU disseminate its policy or
                code-of-conduct that addresses sexual harassment, other
                forms of harassment (non-gender or non-sex based
                harassment prohibited by law), and sexual assault. CSU
                is committed to providing an environment that respects
                the dignity and worth of every member of its community
                including visitors. CSU strives to create and maintain
                a work and study environment that is fair, inclusive,
                and responsible so that each member of the CSU
                community is treated with dignity and respect. To that
                end, CSU has adopted the following policy:
              </p>

              <p>
                <q>
                  Colorado State University's
                  <a href="https://titleix.colostate.edu/title-ix/policy-definitions/">
                  Discrimination, Harassment, Sexual Harassment,
                  Sexual Misconduct, Domestic Violence, Dating
                  Violence, Stalking, and Retaliation Policy</a>
                  prohibits the named behaviors, including sexual
                  assault.
              </q>
              </p>

              <p>
                The policy is well summarized by the
                first sentence at the page linked to above:
                <q>
                  Colorado State University is committed to providing
                  an environment that respects the dignity and worth
                  of every member of its community.
                </q>
                This statement also reflects the values of the
                workshop organizers and the deal.II community at large.
              </p>

              <p>
                CSU's policy identifies the Office of Equal Opportunity
                (OEO) as the office that handles reports of
                discrimination and harassment in employment or
                educational opportunity, including sexual harassment
                complaints involving both students and non-student
                Covered Persons. For detailed information on complaint
                procedures, please visit
                the <a href="https://oeo.colostate.edu/">Office of
                  Equal Opportunity</a>.
