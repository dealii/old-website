Subject: deal.II User and Developer Workshop: August 12-16, 2024

The
   11th deal.II Users' and Developers' workshop
will be held August 12-16, 2024 in Fort Collins, Colorado, USA. The
intent of this workshop is to discuss applications and tools using
deal.II, as well as future directions for the library itself. deal.II
is a widely used open source library supporting finite element
computations.

If you are a user of deal.II, you are invited to participate! In addition
(though this is not a requirement for participation), we invite proposals
for talks and discussion topics by users and existing developers in the
following areas:
 - Use cases and applications of the library.
 - What users think would be useful directions for the library to go 
   into, things that are missing, and possibly getting people together 
   who can help implement those parts.
 - Newer parts of the library (e.g., geometry descriptions, large 
   parallel computations, etc.) and how these could help in your
   programs.
A significant part of the time will be set aside for "hackathon"- or
"code jam"-style sessions where people can ask questions, work on
their codes with others, and receive help from experienced users.

Travel support: A limited amount of (domestic) travel support is

so in your registration! We expect to be able to fully support 50-60
participants.
