            <p>
              There are a number of papers that describe the overall design or
              individual aspects of <abbr>deal.II</abbr>. Please refer to the
              papers listed at the top of
              the <a href="/publications.html">publications page</a> for full
              references. In addition,
              there are the following reports:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A brief report about the classes involved in the
                  <a href="/reports/class-hierarchies/index.html">iterators and accessors</a>
                  used to access cells in the triangulations and the data
                  thereon, such as their geometry, the number of the
                  degrees of freedom, data values, etc. You may want to
                  read this object or parts of it if you want to know what
                  information is available from iterators (by Wolfgang
                  Bangerth).
                </li>

                <li>
                  A brief report on <a href="/reports/mapping_q/index.html">mapping</a> functions of higher polynomial
                  degrees (by Ralf Hartmann). These allow the realisation
                  of higher order boundary approximations. This report
                  gives the theoretical background of the
                  <code>MappingQ</code> class.
                </li>

                <li>
                  A report on
                  <a href="/reports/assemble/assemble.pdf">assembling matrices</a> (by Wolfgang
                  Bangerth). This report looks in particular at how
                  matrices are assembled for vector-valued problems, and
                  how things change if vector-valued finite elements are
                  used for which the shape functions have more than one
                  non-zero vector component, such as Nedelec or
                  Raviart-Thomas elements.
                </li>

                <li>
                  A very detailed report on
                  <a href="/reports/nedelec/nedelec.pdf">Nedelec elements</a> (by Anna
                  Schneebeli, University of Basel, Switzerland). It
                  explains the construction and application of Nedelec
                  edge elements for H-curl spaces, as used, for example,
                  in the numerical solution of the Maxwell equations. It
                  also gives numerical results obtained with deal.II.
                </li>

                <li>
                  A report on the
                  <a href="/reports/codimension-one/desimone-heltai-manigrasso.pdf">codimension one</a> capabilities of the library
                  (by Antonio DeSimone, Luca Heltai and Cataldo Manigrasso,
                  SISSA, Trieste, Italy). It explains in detail how to use the
                  library for the solution of problems defined on codimension
                  one manifolds, such as, for example, Boundary Element
                  Methods.
