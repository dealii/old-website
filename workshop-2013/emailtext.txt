Dear deal.II users and developers,

the fourth deal.II users' and developers' workshop will be held
August 19-22 in College Station, TX. The intent of this workshop
is to discuss applications and tools using deal.II, as well as
future directions of the library itself.

We invite talks and plan discussions by users and existing
developers in the following areas:
 - use cases and applications of the library
 - what users think would be useful directions for the library
   to go into, things that are missing, and possibly getting
   people together who can help implement those parts
 - newer parts of the library (e.g., cmake, large parallel
   computations, etc.) and how these could help in your programs.
The workshop will also have several "code jam" sessions where people
can ask questions, work on their codes together, and receive help
from experienced users.

Registration:
Please register via an informal email to buerg@math.tamu.edu
and include the following information:
- your full name

Deadline for registration: June 30, 2013.
