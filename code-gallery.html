            <h2>The deal.II Code Gallery</h2>

            <p>
              The deal.II "code gallery" is an extension to the
              deal.II tutorial. While the tutorial's emphasis is on
              teaching aspects of deal.II by providing concrete
              examples &mdash; and extensive documentation and
              discussion &mdash; of how parts of deal.II are used in
              applications, the intent of the code gallery is <i>to
              provide starting points</i> for your own codes by making
              available codes others have already written.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              As a general rule:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The code gallery is not part of deal.II. The
                  applications in the code gallery were written by
                  users who wanted to make their codes available.
                </li>

                <li>
                  The applications in the code gallery are generally
                  not as well tested or documented as the tutorial
                  programs. <b>These codes come with no warranty at
                  all.</b> If you have questions, you need to
                  contact the authors of these codes, not the authors
                  of deal.II.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>We welcome additions and improvements to existing
                  codes, as well as new code gallery applications!</b>
                  Most users start their own applications from an
                  existing tutorial program. Having more starting
                  points helps others, but it also gives code gallery
                  authors additional ways to get recognition for their
                  own codes! See below

              To see what codes are part of the code
              gallery,
              see <a href="https://dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/CodeGallery.html">this
              list</a>.
              You can also see how these codes build on the tutorial
              programs by finding the open circles on
              the <a href="https://dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/Tutorial.html#graph">graph

            <h2>Downloading the code gallery</h2>

            <p>
              You can get the entire code gallery from its github home
              by using the command
              <code>
                <pre>
git clone https://github.com/dealii/code-gallery.git</pre>
              </code>
              This creates a directory <code>code-gallery/</code> that
              contains all code gallery programs.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you want to generate the deal.II documentation
              locally and want it to also cross-link to the code
              gallery, you need to do the step above within your copy
              of deal.II, i.e., so that the command above creates a
              directory <code>code-gallery/</code> parallel to the
              <code>include/</code>,
              <code>source/</code>, and
              <code>examples/</code> directories (and others).

            <h2>Contributing codes to the gallery</h2>

            <p>First: <b>We appreciate all contributions!</b> We have
            tried to set the bar to entry as low as possible. In
            essence, here is all you have to do:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                Create a fork of the git repository for the code
                gallery. To this end, you need to have an account at
                <a href="http://github.com">github.com</a>. Log in,
                then go
                to <a href="https://github.com/dealii/code-gallery">https://github.com/dealii/code-gallery</a>
                and click on the "Fork" symbol at the top right.
              </li>
              
              <li>
                This yields a copy of the code gallery repository to
                which you are allowed to write (a "fork"). At the
                right side of the page, you will find its HTTPS
                address. Check out a copy of it to your local hard drive via
                <code>
                  <pre>
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/code-gallery.git</pre>
                </code>
                where you replace <code>myusername</code> with your
                github user name.
              </li>
              
              <li>
                Go into the <code>code-gallery</code> directory just
                generated. Within it, create a new directory for your
                project, named as you like.
              </li>

              <li>
                Put your source files and everything else you need
                into this directory. In addition, the following files
                and subdirectories need to exist:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                    <code>Readme.md</code>:
                    A <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics">markdown formatted</a> file that
                    provides a basic overview of what this program
                    does. You can use latex-style formulas enclosed
                    in <code>$...$</code>, or offset via
                    <code><pre>
  @f{align*}{
    ...
  @f}</pre></code>
                    to explain ideas.
                    </p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p>
                    <code>CMakeLists.txt</code>:
                    A Cmake file that allows others to build your
                    code. It must be possible to simply run it via
                    <code>
                    <pre>
cmake -DDEAL_II_DIR=/path/to/dealii . ; make ; make run</pre>
                    </code>
                    </p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p>
                    <code>doc/entry-name</code>:
                    A file that contains a simple, short name of
                    the program. This will likely match the directory
                    name, but can contain spaces and special
                    characters (encoded in HTML, if necessary). This
                    name will be used in the title line of the
                    program's page, as well as in
                    the <a href="https://dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/CodeGallery.html">the
                    list of programs</a>.

                    <p>
                    <code>doc/tooltip</code>:
                    A one-line description of the program that is
                    shown when hovering over a symbol in the
                    connection graph.
                    </p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p>
                    <code>doc/builds-on</code>:
                    A list of the form
                    <code>
                    <pre>
step-XX step-YY gallery-NNNN gallery-MMMM</pre>
                    </code>
                    where <code>XX</code> and <code>YY</code> are the
                    numbers of existing tutorials programs that your
                    application builds on, and <code>NNNN</code>
                    and <code>MMMM</code> are the names of existing
                    gallery applications. This information is used to
                    build
                    the <a href="http://dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/Tutorial.html#graph">connection

                    <p>
                    <code>doc/author</code>:

                    <p>
                    <code>doc/dependencies</code>:
                    A file with a list of entries of the form
                    <code>
                    <pre>
DEAL_II_WITH_CXX11 DEAL_II_WITH_TRILINOS</pre>
                    </code>
                    that specifies what requirements you need of the
                    underlying deal.II installation for your program
                    to run. The entries are Cmake variables that are
                    set during deal.II configuration and correspond to
                    the items you find printed in the summary at the
                    end of a <code>cmake</code> run when configuring
                    deal.II.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>

              <li>
                Create a branch in your local git copy:
                    <code>
                    <pre>
git branch my-code-gallery-project
git checkout my-code-gallery-project</pre></code>
              </li>

              <li>
                Add your code gallery project to the git directory and
                upload it to your fork of the repository:
                    <code>
                    <pre>
git add my-project-name
git push origin my-code-gallery-project</pre></code>
              </li>

              <li>
                Go to your github code-gallery page, which should be
                named <code>https://github.com/myusername/code-gallery</code>. Sign
                in if necessary. It should allow you to create a "pull
                request" for your new code gallery project. Do so --
                this will alert the deal.II maintainers to the fact
                that you want to contribute a new project, and sets up
                a short code review process.
