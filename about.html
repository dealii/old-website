	  <h2>What is <abbr>deal.II</abbr>?</h2>

	  <p>
	    <abbr>deal.II</abbr> &mdash; a name that originally meant
	    to indicate that it is the successor to the
	    <b style="color: #50B0F0">D</b>ifferential
	    <b style="color: #50B0F0">E</b>quations
	    <b style="color: #50B0F0">A</b>nalysis
	    <b style="color: #50B0F0">L</b>ibrary &mdash; is a C++ program library targeted at
	    the computational solution of partial differential equations using adaptive
	    finite elements. It uses state-of-the-art programming techniques to
	    offer you a modern interface to the complex data
	    structures and algorithms required.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    The main aim of <abbr>deal.II</abbr> is to enable rapid
	    development of modern finite element codes, using among other
	    aspects adaptive
	    meshes and a wide array of tools classes often used in finite element
	    program. Writing such programs is a non-trivial task, and
	    successful programs tend to become very large and complex. We
	    believe that this is best done using a program library
	    that takes care of the details of grid
	    handling and refinement, handling of degrees of freedom, input
	    of meshes and output of results in graphics formats, and the
	    like. Likewise, support for several space dimensions at once is
	    included in a way such that programs can be written independent of
	    the space dimension without unreasonable penalties on run-time and
	    memory consumption.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    <abbr>deal.II</abbr> is widely used in many
	    <a href="publications.html" target="body">academic and commercial
	      projects</a>. For its creation, its principal authors have received
	    the <a href="http://www.nag.co.uk/other/wilkinsonprize.asp"
		   target="_top">2007 J. H. Wilkinson Prize for Numerical
	      Software</a>. It is also part of the industry
	    standard <a href="http://www.spec.org/cpu2006/" target="_top">SPEC CPU
	      2006</a> and <a href="http://www.spec.org/cpu2017/" target="_top">SPEC CPU
	      2017</a> benchmark
	    suites used to determine the speed of computers and compilers.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    <abbr>deal.II</abbr> originally emerged from work at the
	    <a href="http://numerik.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/" target="_top">Numerical
	      Methods Group</a> at Universit&auml;t Heidelberg, Germany, which is at
	    the forefront of adaptive finite element methods and error estimators.
	    Today, it is a global, open source project maintained by a
	      <a href="authors.html">geographically diverse set of
		developers</a>, and
	      has <a href="authors.html" 
		     target="body">dozens of contributors</a> and several hundred users
	    scattered around the world. Over the years, development of deal.II has
	    been funded as ancillary products of various grants from the Deutsche
	    Forschungsgemeinschaft, the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/">National
	      Science Foundation</a>, and other funding agencies around the
	    world. We have also received direct funding for particular projects from
	    the <a href="http://www.geodynamics.org/">Computational Infrastructure
	      in Geodynamics</a> initiative.

	  <h2>What <abbr>deal.II</abbr> can offer you</h2>

	  <p>
	    If you are active in the field of adaptive finite element methods,
	    <abbr>deal.II</abbr> might be the right library for your
	    projects. Among other features, it offers:
	  </p>

	  <ul>
	    <li> <p>
		Support for one, two, and three space dimensions, using a
		unified interface that allows to write programs almost
		dimension independent.
	      </p>

	    <li> <p>
		Handling of locally refined grids, including different adaptive
		refinement strategies based on local error indicators and
		error estimators. Both <i>h</i>, <i>p</i>, and <i>hp</i> refinement is
		fully supported for continuous and discontinuous elements.
	      </p>

	    <li> <p>
		Support for a variety of finite elements: Lagrange
		elements of any order, continuous and discontinuous; Nedelec and
		Raviart-Thomas elements of any order;
		elements composed of other elements.
	      </p>

	    <li> <p>
		Parallelization on single machine through the Threading Build Blocks
		and across nodes via MPI. <abbr>deal.II</abbr> has been shown
		to scale to at least 16k processors.
	      </p>

	    <li> <p>
		Extensive documentation: all documentation is available online
		in a logical tree structure to allow fast access to the information
		you need. If printed it comprises more than 500 pages of tutorials,
		several reports, and presently some 5,000 pages of programming
		interface documentation with explanations of all classes,
		functions, and variables. All documentation comes with the
		library and is available online locally on your computer after
		installation.
	      </p>

	    <li> <p>
		Modern software techniques that make access to the complex
		data structures and algorithms as transparent as possible.
		The use of object oriented programming allows for program
		structures similar to the structures in mathematical analysis.
	      </p>

	    <li> <p>
		A complete stand-alone linear algebra library including sparse
		matrices, vectors, Krylov subspace solvers, support for blocked
		systems, and interface to other packages such as Trilinos, PETSc and
		METIS.
	      </p>

	    <li> <p>
		Support for several output formats, including many common
		formats for visualization of scientific data.
	      </p>

	    <li> <p>
		Portable support for a variety of computer platforms and compilers.
	      </p>

	    <li> <p>
		Free source code under an Open Source license, and the
		invitation to contribute to further development of the
		library.
	      </p>
	  </ul>
