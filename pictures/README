This directory contains the icons used on the homepage.

The directory gallery contains thumbnails of pictures in the Wiki
gallery. All these pictures must have a width of 100 pixels and their
aspect ratio should be close to one.

These pictures must have exactly the same name as the ones in the Wiki
gallery, since the links are generated from filenames.

A convenient way of generating the thumbnails is using the script getpic:

perl ../../cgi-bin/getpic.pl <picname>
rm rawpicname

This will download the picture from the wiki and convert it to the
correct size. The raw picture should be deleted and NOT committed.
