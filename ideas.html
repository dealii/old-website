            <h2>Project ideas</h2>

            <p>
              <abbr>deal.II</abbr> is a community project that lives
              by the <a href="participate.html">participation of its
              members</a>. It grows by members of our community
              implementing things that they find interesting,
              important, gratifying, or useful for their own
              work. Here are a few ideas for larger projects that
              would make a significant difference:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Parallel <code>hp::DoFHandler</code>:</b>
                Currently, only the <code>::DoFHandler</code> class
                can work on parallel or shared triangulations, but
                <code>hp::DoFHandler</code> can not. This is a serious
                obstacles not only for people who really want to
                do <i>hp</i> adaptivity, but also for those who want
                to use <code>FE_Nothing</code> on some cells in the
                style of step-46, and want to do so for parallel
                computations.
                <br>
                We know pretty well what steps one needs to take to
                get us there, but lack the time to do it. It would,
                however, make for a nice and self-contained project
                with big pay-off.
              </li>

              <li>
                <b>Write a finite element:</b> deal.II implements a
                fair number of different elements, but there are many
                more out there. Examples include the various
                elasticity elements, serendipity elements, and a number of nonconforming
                elements. These make for relatively self-contained
                projects since one really only has to understand one
                particular aspect of deal.II -- the interfaces of
                the <code>FiniteElement</code> class and how it
                interacts with <code>FEValues</code> and a rather
                limited set of other functions.
                <br>
                An often requested feature would also be a tutorial
                program that walks users through the process of
                writing an element description. In other words, a
                tutorial program that <i>shows</i> how one would write a
                finite element would be fantastic.
              </li>

              <li>
                <b>Complex valued algebra:</b> Many scientific
                applications demand usage of complex valued algebra.
                Being a heavily templated C++ library, deal.II is
                almost ready to support that usage case.  Much of the
                preliminary work was done in the following
                pull-requests
                <a href="https://github.com/dealii/dealii/pull/1027">1027</a>,
                and <a href="https://github.com/dealii/dealii/pull/631">631</a>.
                However there is some work left to do to make the
                issue completely fixed (see github issue
                <a href="https://github.com/dealii/dealii/issues/1894">1894</a>
                and
                <a href="https://github.com/dealii/dealii/issues/2033">2033</a>). Completing
                these remaining steps would make a nice
                and self-contained project.
              </li>

              <li>
                <b>Restructure finite element interfaces:</b> The
                interfaces of the finite element and mapping classes
                date back to the earliest times of deal.II when we
                were not as experienced software designers as we are
                now. Much of this has been rewritten in 2015 as part of
                <a href="https://github.com/dealii/dealii/issues/1198">github
                issue 1198</a>, but a few odd corners remain. In
                particular, there are a couple of classes that take a
                template argument that designates a class that
                describes a polynomial space, when it would be
                entirely sufficient to just receive a reference to a
                class object (rather than a class type) that
                represents this space, see
                <a href="https://github.com/dealii/dealii/issues/1973">github
                issue 1973</a>. Making this change would eliminate a
                template argument, improve compile time, and make the
                interfaces easier to understand.
              </li>

              <li>
                <b>Use C++11 lambda functions:</b> In many places
                where we spawn tasks for parallel processing, we
                implement these tasks in separate functions because in
                C++98 and C++03, tasks required providing a pointer to
                a (named) function. C++11 now has lambda functions,
                and so a simpler way to achieve the same goal is to
                implement the code to be executed on a task as a
                lambda function, declared right at the place where one
                wants to use it. Examples for this are in the
                implementation of parallelized vector operations for
                multithreading, and many of the places where we
                call <code>Threads::new_task()</code>.
              </li>

              <li>
                <b>Improve error messages:</b> In the past, we have
                often just provided the equivalent of an "An error has
                occurred" statement if a user called a function with
                wrong arguments, but this is not as useful as could be
                to find out what exactly it was that you did wrong. A
                better approach is to be much more verbose with error
                messages. We track our progress towards this goal in
                <a href="https://github.com/dealii/dealii/issues/610">github
                issue 610</a>.
              </li>

              <li>
                <b>Linux based installer:</b> We have been working on
		providing a source based installer on linux systems, but this
		requires additional testing, support for more systems/clusters
		and writing
		documentation. See 
		<a href="https://github.com/dealii/dealii/issues/1523">github
		issue 1523</a> for more information.
              </li>

             <li>
                <b>Saving memory for very large parallel computations:</b>
                When doing large scale parappel computations especially with a
                large coarse mesh, large amounts of memory are wasted. This is
                true especially when using an MPI only approach, because a
                single node will have many (redundant) copies of the
                data. There are several ways to re-organize the data
                structures or using special MPI support for shared
                allocations. See 
		<a href="https://github.com/dealii/dealii/issues/2209">github
		issue 2209</a> for more information.
              </li>

              <li>
                <b>Easy enhancement projects:</b> Some smaller
                projects are also described on the 
                <a href="https://github.com/dealii/dealii/issues">list
                  of open issues</a> at our github site. 
              </li>

            </ul>

            <p>
              If you want to work on any of these projects: awesome! A good
              starting point would be to <a href="authors.html">contact the
              principal developers</a> so we can coordinate finding someone to
              mentor you.
