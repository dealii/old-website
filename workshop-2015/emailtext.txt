Dear deal.II users and developers,

The Fifth 
    deal.II Users' and Developers' workshop
will be held August 3-7, 2015 in College Station, TX. The intent of this
workshop is to discuss applications and tools using deal.II, as well as future
directions of the library itself.

We invite talks and plan discussions by users and existing developers in the
following areas:
 - use cases and applications of the library
 - what users think would be useful directions for the library to go into,
   things that are missing, and possibly getting people together who can help
   implement those parts
 - newer parts of the library (e.g., cmake, large parallel
   computations, etc.) and how these could help in your programs.
A significant part of the time will be set aside for "hackathon"- or "code
jam"-style sessions where people can ask questions, work on their codes
with others, and receive help from experienced users.
