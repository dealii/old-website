	      <h3>Program and Topics</h3>

	      <p>
		The Summer School consists of a three day introduction to
		computational methods for PDEs that includes an introduction
		to the <a href="https://dealii.org">deal.II finite element
		library</a>, followed by a four day deal.II workshop (see the
		separate website for the <a href="../workshop-2019/">deal.II
		  workshop</a>).
		</p>
		
	      <p>
		<b>Audience</b><br>

		The audience for this workshop are primarily graduate students
		in the US, be we would like to encourage interested
		undergraduate students to apply.
              </p>

              <p>
                The Computational Science community is not diverse,
                with women and minorities woefully
                underrepresented. This Summer School is an attempt at
                addressing this situation in some sense, and we will
                give women and applicants from underrepresented groups
                substantial priority.
                
              <p>
                To participate successfully, you should have some
		background in programming, and knowledge about ODEs/PDEs and
		linear algebra. We will review the mathematical foundations
		throughout the course, though.
		</p>
		
	      <p>
		<b>Content</b><br>

		The first part of this school will consist of a mix of
		lectures, hands-on tutorials, and free time to experiment. Our
		plan is to cover a broad spectrum of topics including:

		<ul>
		  <li> An introduction to PDEs
		  <li> An introduction to basic numerical methods and numerical linear algebra
		  <li> An overview of the Finite Element Method with a focus on practical aspects
		  <li> A tutorial on the deal.II Finite Element library
		  <li> A conversation about career opportunities in computational mathematics.
		</ul>

		The goal is to introduce participants to the world of
		practical PDE solution methods and, in particular, for
		participation in part two,
		the <a href="../workshop-2019/">deal.II workshop</a>
		that is otherwise intended for
		existing deal.II users and developers.
		</p>
		

	      <p>
		<b>Schedule:</b>
		<ul>
		  <li> August 2: arrival
		  <li> August 3-5: Summer School with lectures, tutorials, tinker time
		  <li> August 6-9: deal.II workshop
		  <li> August 10: departure
		</ul>

	      <h3>Travel Information to Fort Collins, CO</h3>

	      <p>
		Fort Collins is located in Colorado, approximately one
		hour north of Denver. To get there, you would fly to Denver (airport code DEN, serviced
		by all major domestic and many international
		airlines). There is then a <a href="http://greenrideco.hudsonltd.net/res?USERIDENTRY=CSUEMP&LOGON=GO">shuttle</a> that takes you
		directly to Fort Collins, with the option of being
		dropped off on campus, close to the hotel for
		participants.

	      <h3>Code of Conduct</h3>

              <p>
                Colorado State University is receiving funding from
                the National Science Foundation to support this
                conference. As a condition of the conference grant,
                NSF requires that CSU disseminate its policy or
                code-of-conduct that addresses sexual harassment, other
                forms of harassment (non-gender or non-sex based
                harassment prohibited by law), and sexual assault. CSU
                is committed to providing an environment that respects
                the dignity and worth of every member of its community
                including visitors. CSU strives to create and maintain
                a work and study environment that is fair, inclusive,
                and responsible so that each member of the CSU
                community is treated with dignity and respect. To that
                end, CSU has adopted the following policy:
              </p>

              <p>
              <q>
                <a href="https://oeo.colostate.edu/discrimination-harassment-sexual-harassment-sexual-misconduct-domestic-violence-dating-violence-stalking-and-retaliation-policy/">CSU's
                  Discrimination, Harassment, Sexual Harassment,
                  Sexual Misconduct, Domestic Violence, Dating
                  Violence, Stalking, and Retaliation Policy (Policy)
                  prohibits the named behaviors, including sexual
                  assault.</a>
              </q>
              </p>

              <p>
                The Policy identifies the Office of Equal Opportunity
                (OEO) as the office that handles reports of
                discrimination and harassment in employment or
                educational opportunity, including sexual harassment
                complaints involving both students and non-student
                Covered Persons. For detailed information on complaint
                procedures, please visit
                the <a href="https://oeo.colostate.edu/">Office of
                  Equal Opportunity</a>.
