	    <p>
	      <abbr>deal.II</abbr> is a project that has many ways for
	      you to obtain help on any question you may have. In particular,
	      there are many pages that can help you with particular
	      questions:

	      <ul>
		<li> 
		  The <a href="http://www.dealii.org/developer/readme.html">ReadMe</a>
		  file provides information on installation instructions.
		</li>

		<li> 
		  The main documentation of deal.II comes in the form
		  of <a href="http://dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/Tutorial.html">tutorials</a>
		  &mdash; a sequence of little programs
		  that demonstrate features of <abbr>deal.II</abbr>
		  &mdash;
		  and
		  the <a href="http://dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/index.html">manual</a>
		  &mdash; information about every class
		  and function in <abbr>deal.II</abbr>.
		</li>

		<li>
		  Our <a href="https://github.com/dealii/dealii/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions">Frequently
		    Asked Questions</a> answer some problems often
		  encountered. Some other information is cataloged on
		  the <a href="https://github.com/dealii/dealii/wiki">Wiki</a>.
		</li>

		<li>
		  <a href="http://www.math.colostate.edu/~bangerth/videos.html">Wolfgang's

		  element method in general, as well as programming questions
		  and <abbr>deal.II</abbr> in particular.
		</li>
	      </ul>

	    <p>
	      If you can't find a question answered in any of these places,
	      can't find where something would be described, or don't know
	      how to do something, then one of the <abbr>deal.II</abbr>
