<h1>Location Information for the 2009 CBMS Conference on AFEM</h1>

<p>
The conference lectures will take place in Room 117 on the first floor
of the Blocker Building at Texas A&amp;M University. This is the diagonal
building on Ireland Street, just south of University Drive. See the green
arrow on the map below. It is behind the construction site of the almost
completed physics building (though the latter is not yet visible on the
satellite image below).

<p>
If you are driving directly to the conference site, you can either
park at St. Mary's parking lot or in the North Side Garage (blue
arrows).

<p>
The Hampton Inn is at 320 Texas Ave. South (red arrow), in walking
distance of the campus.
