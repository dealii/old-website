	  <h4>General Information</h4>
	  <p>
	    Finite element methods (FEM) are widely used in the computational
	    solution of partial differential equations in the sciences and engineering.
	    The course is intended to give students a perspective on the practical aspects
	    of the FEM, in particular on how typical finite element software
	    is structured, on algorithmic details of how to efficiently implement it, and
	    on pre- and postprocessing steps.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    The goal is for students to have
	    a finite element code at
	    the end of the course for simulations that are part of
	    their PhD research.

      <h4>Target audience</h4>
    </a>

    <p>
      The course is intended for masters and doctoral students as well
      as postdocs who have to
      solve partial differential equations as part of their
      research. This includes both people who are interested in
      developing computational methods using model problems, as well
      as for those who just want to solve PDEs as part of their
      applied science research (e.g. in physics, chemistry, biology,
      engineering). The outcome of the course is that every
      participant should have a code at the end that supports their
      research.
    </p>

    <p>
      Participants need not be experts in the finite element method,
      but need to have knowledge of both basic numerical methods
      (quadrature, solving linear systems) as well as programming,
      preferably in C++.
    </p>

    <p>
      The course will run daily 9-12 and 1-4 between March 19 and
      March 30 in the left half of the IWR computer pool in the
      Otto-Meyerhof-Zentrum next to the IWR building. For a map,
      <a href="http://www.klinikum.uni-heidelberg.de/Wegweiser.4520.0.html">see
      here</a>. To find the computer pool, enter the side door on the
      east side (right on the map), go to the basement, and follow the
      long hallwall down; it's the second door on the right.

      <h4>Rationale for this course</h4>
    </a>

    <p>
      One of the most important lessons learned over the past decade is
      that due to their size, modern numerical software can't be written from scratch
      for each new project, and must instead build on existing software libraries
      that handle most of what constitutes the finite element method as well as
      linear algebra and parallel communication. Applications then only have to
      implement things like bilinear forms, outer nonlinear solution loops, and
      linear solvers specialized to the application.
    </p>

    <p>
      The course will use a large Open Source finite element library and other open
      source tools for the entire workflow. The library, deal.II,
      can be found at <a href="http://www.dealii.org/">http://www.dealii.org/</a> and is developed mainly at Texas A&amp;M University
      in
      collaboration with other researchers worldwide. It is used as the standard
      research and teaching tool for numerical computing in the Department of
      Mathematics. It supports the discretization of arbitrary partial differential
      equations and runs on machines from laptops to supercomputers with more than
      10,000 processors.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first part of the course will be used to review the basic mathematical
      concepts used in this software, such as finite element theory and iterative
      solvers. The rest of the course will be used for projects in which students
      are guided through the implementation of an application related to their
      research project or interests. Part of this will be teaching the use of
      modern software engineering practices, such as the use of revision control management
      systems (e.g. Subversion), writing documentation, and writing tests for
      automated testsuites. The goal is the development of a code that a) helps in
      the research of a student, and b) may be used as the starting point for future
      generations of students. It may also be converted into a tutorial for deal.II.
    </p>

      <h4>Literature</h4>
    </a>

    <p>
      To the best of my knowledge, there isn't much in terms of books on writing
      large-scale software for finite element simulations. What is there often
      treats a single software package; for example, there are books about FEMLAB
      and DiffPack, two commercial finite element packages. For the packages to be
      used in class, there are no such books, but deal.II has several thousand pages
      of documentation. It can be found at
      the deal.II homepage at <a href="http://www.dealii.org/">http://www.dealii.org/</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the other topics, there are good books. There is a plethora of
      books about the theory of finite elements; for iterative solvers of
      linear and nonlinear systems, the following books are commonly
      referenced:
      <ul>
	<li>  Y. Saad, "Iterative Methods for Sparse Linear Systems" (an
	  exhaustive book on the theory of iterative solvers)
	<li>  R. Barrett et al., "Templates for the Solution of Linear Systems"
	  (a short book explaining the implementation of a variety of linear
	  solvers)
	<li>  C. T. Kelley, "Iterative Methods for Linear and Nonlinear
	  Equations"
      </ul>


      The use of Subversion is explained in
      <ul>
	<li> C. M. Pilato et al., "Version
	  Control with Subversion" (this book is also available <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/index.html">online</a>)
      </ul>
      Other software design techniques such as unit testing and automated
      build systems are treated in many Computer Science texts, but what is
      needed will also be covered in class.
