            <h1>The deal.II Seminar Series</h1>

            <p>
              <abbr>deal.II</abbr> is a large project: There are many
              pieces you've probably never seen,
              and <a href="publications.html">hundreds of
              applications</a> you probably never thought about or
              didn't even think were possible to write
              with <abbr>deal.II</abbr>. It's also a a project in
              which a lot of <i><a href="authors.html">people</a></i> are involved, with ideas
              and careers worth talking about.
            </p>

            <p>
              The <i><abbr>deal.II</abbr> Seminar Series</i> is a way
              to talk about both scientific things, but also about the
              people involved. Seminars last about 45 minutes and are
              generally in more of a <i>conversational</i> style: Yes,
              the first 15-20 minutes are a scientific talk, followed by
              a few minutes of audience questions, but the rest is a
              conversation between the speaker and an
              experienced <abbr>deal.II</abbr> developer, possibly
              interspersed by interactive demonstrations, detours, and
              excursions &mdash; a fireside chat between computational
              scientists.
            </p>

            <p>
              Seminars run live once a month on the last Friday of
              each month at 10:00 US East Coast Time (07:00 US Pacific
              Time; usually 16:00 Central European Time; usually 22:00
              China Time).
              Recordings are also available at a later time via YouTube.
